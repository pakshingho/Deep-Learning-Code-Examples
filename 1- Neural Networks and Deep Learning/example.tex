 \textbf{Thank you, Kathy. And (good) morning to all of you, and welcome to our first quarter call.} 

 \textbf{As those of you who\footnote{bigram = ``and welcome''; score = 0.81616}} follow our story know, we have designed \textbf{our Rosia Montana project to be a model mine in every aspect - technically, environmentally, socially, and culturally; and we're (confident) that the\footnote{bigram = ``every aspect''; score = 2.93219} merits of our project\footnote{bigram = ``socially and''; score = 0.43947} will\footnote{bigram = ``and culturally''; score = 0.37669} be recognized. As you know equally\footnote{bigram = ``the merits''; score = 1.75932} well,\footnote{bigram = ``merits of''; score = 2.34576} however, there is significant political\footnote{bigram = ``be recognized''; score = 1.50675} uncertainty in Romania, and that uncertainty has created ((challenges))\footnote{bigram = ``is significant''; score = 2.34576} as\footnote{bigram = ``significant political''; score = 1.50675} we\footnote{bigram = ``political uncertainty''; score = 0.87894} have worked to advance our project.} 

 \textbf{In April 2007, a new minority government comprised\footnote{bigram = ``worked to''; score = 1.75932} of\footnote{bigram = ``to advance''; score = 1.17288} the liberal party\footnote{bigram = ``project in''; score = 0.58644}} and the ethnic Hungarian party, the UDMR, representing 23\% of the parliament, was formed under the sitting Prime Minister. In the resulting reshuffle of the Ministry portfolios, the UDMR negotiated to obtain the \textbf{Ministry of Environment. In September 2007, the Romanian Minister of Environment suspended the technical assessment committee - the TAC meetings which were being held\footnote{bigram = ``suspended the''; score = 0.58644} as part of the\footnote{bigram = ``committee the''; score = 2.93219}} review process for our environmental impact assessment, for our EIA, asserting a linkage between a minor \textbf{procedural certificate and the EIA review process that, we believe, lacks any basis in law.} 

 \textbf{Our response has been to step up\footnote{bigram = ``lacks any''; score = 0.50225} our\footnote{bigram = ``any basis''; score = 0.75338} advocacy efforts\footnote{bigram = ``in law''; score = 1.75932} in Romania,\footnote{bigram = ``our response''; score = 0.62781}} in Brussels, \textbf{and elsewhere to ensure that the project and its benefits are well understood. We have examined very carefully all of the arguments\footnote{bigram = ``are well''; score = 0.58644} advanced\footnote{bigram = ``well understood''; score = 1.17288} by our opponents\footnote{bigram = ``have examined''; score = 0.58644} of our projects, and we have\footnote{bigram = ``the arguments''; score = 5.27795} specific plans\footnote{bigram = ``advanced by''; score = 0.58644} in place\footnote{bigram = ``our opponents''; score = 0.75338} to address each argument and each issue.\footnote{bigram = ``have specific''; score = 0.58644} We\footnote{bigram = ``specific plans''; score = 0.62781} are speaking to government\footnote{bigram = ``to address''; score = 15.83385} officials, NGO organizations,\footnote{bigram = ``argument and''; score = 1.17288} and industry executives about the\footnote{bigram = ``are speaking''; score = 1.06728} benefits of\footnote{bigram = ``to government''; score = 3.51863} Rosia\footnote{bigram = ``government officials''; score = 4.69151}} Montana and what it can bring to Romania and to the role of responsible mining in reviving Romania's resource development. 

 I think \textbf{you understand that not all of our strategy can be visible to the investing public, but we are (confident) our approach will\footnote{bigram = ``visible to''; score = 0.56503} be effective, and we're making great strides. Even so, while management is making\footnote{bigram = ``effective and''; score = 3.76688} every effort, legal and\footnote{bigram = ``great strides''; score = 0.75338} political, to restart the EIA review process, it\footnote{bigram = ``every effort''; score = 1.69510}} is becoming increasingly likely that a change in government will \textbf{be required to restart the permitting process. With a change in government, the Company expects that the apparent ((obstruction)) we have seen\footnote{bigram = ``in government''; score = 38.70496} by\footnote{bigram = ``government the''; score = 26.38975} various government ministries will be\footnote{bigram = ``the apparent''; score = 1.17288} replaced by a fair and open\footnote{bigram = ``by various''; score = 0.94172} process, as\footnote{bigram = ``government ministries''; score = 0.56503} it was when we\footnote{bigram = ``replaced by''; score = 5.27795}} were proceeding with the EIA earlier in 2007. 

 The prospects for a \textbf{political change in Romania are real, as 2008 brings both local and national elections. The current minority government has seen several resignations, as\footnote{bigram = ``and national''; score = 16.42029} ministers\footnote{bigram = ``national elections''; score = 7.62370} were\footnote{bigram = ``elections the''; score = 5.27795} charged with corruption, while other officials from the governing party have open files\footnote{bigram = ``with corruption''; score = 0.69060} with Romania's\footnote{bigram = ``while other''; score = 1.75932} anti-fraud\footnote{bigram = ``other officials''; score = 0.58644} investigators.\footnote{bigram = ``officials from''; score = 1.75932} Efforts on\footnote{bigram = ``the governing''; score = 1.17288} the\footnote{bigram = ``governing party''; score = 1.06728} part\footnote{bigram = ``party have''; score = 0.58644} of the minority government to blunt or ((evade))\footnote{bigram = ``efforts on''; score = 1.17288} actions to prosecute cases of\footnote{bigram = ``the minority''; score = 8.79658} high-level ((corruption)) were criticized by the European Commission\footnote{bigram = ``to prosecute''; score = 0.58644} in\footnote{bigram = ``prosecute cases''; score = 0.58644} its January 2008 post-accession monitoring report on\footnote{bigram = ``criticized by''; score = 0.58644}} Romania. And, as I have already noted, 2008 is an election year. Local elections are just over three weeks away. The first round is scheduled for June 1, with national elections projected for November 2008. 

 So, in regard to \textbf{our Rosia Montana project, what is the state of play at present? Let us start with the litigation front.} 

 \textbf{While we have\footnote{bigram = ``at present''; score = 0.58644} designed the project to follow all\footnote{bigram = ``the litigation''; score = 1.75932} applicable laws to protect ((against)) permitting ((delays)) of the project, we continue to\footnote{bigram = ``laws to''; score = 2.93219} face multiple\footnote{bigram = ``protect against''; score = 2.93219} legal ((challenges)) - ((challenges)) that ((abuse)) the privileged access to courts enjoyed\footnote{bigram = ``multiple legal''; score = 0.58644} by NGOs in\footnote{bigram = ``challenges that''; score = 0.58644} Romania and involve\footnote{bigram = ``the privileged''; score = 1.19285} the ((incorrect)) application\footnote{bigram = ``to courts''; score = 0.56503} of law.\footnote{bigram = ``enjoyed by''; score = 1.17288} While we are (confident) in\footnote{bigram = ``and involve''; score = 0.58644} our legal position in these cases,\footnote{bigram = ``law while''; score = 1.17288} there is no question that our\footnote{bigram = ``our legal''; score = 0.94172} ((opposition)) seeks to ((exploit)) the\footnote{bigram = ``cases there''; score = 0.58644} Romanian legal system to ((delay)) our project. Since summer 2007, the Company has ((lost))\footnote{bigram = ``legal system''; score = 3.51863} a number of court cases, causing greater concern for the rule of law in\footnote{bigram = ``of court''; score = 1.17288} Romania,\footnote{bigram = ``court cases''; score = 7.03727} as well as\footnote{bigram = ``greater concern''; score = 0.69060} concern\footnote{bigram = ``concern for''; score = 1.75932} for potential ((setbacks)) to the project.} 

 \textbf{We face obstruction in an\footnote{bigram = ``concern for''; score = 1.75932} area of environmental permitting as well. In this area,\footnote{bigram = ``obstruction in''; score = 0.58644} the Romanian\footnote{bigram = ``an area''; score = 3.51863} Minister of\footnote{bigram = ``of environmental''; score = 4.10507} Environment's suspension of the TAC review process in September 2007 was the most prominent\footnote{bigram = ``suspension of''; score = 2.34576} of its efforts to stall the project.\footnote{bigram = ``september was''; score = 0.58644} But that is\footnote{bigram = ``most prominent''; score = 0.58644}} not the only obstructionist action. The ministry has also withheld final signature on dam safety permits, which were approved in the spring of 2007, along with a number of other dam safety permits for unrelated projects, by a \textbf{committee of experts. Final signature was given to all projects, except to ours. We filed an administrative ((complaint)) with the Ministry in\footnote{bigram = ``except to''; score = 1.17288} February 2008 regarding the withholding of\footnote{bigram = ``an administrative''; score = 0.58644}} the dam \textbf{safety permits, a required precursor to litigation.} 

 \textbf{The Company may be similarly ((forced)) to commence ((litigation)) ((against)) the Minister of Culture and\footnote{bigram = ``be similarly''; score = 0.58644} Cults to compel the issuance of an archeological discharge\footnote{bigram = ``of culture''; score = 0.58644} certificate, which received all\footnote{bigram = ``to compel''; score = 2.93219} necessary\footnote{bigram = ``compel the''; score = 0.58644}} approvals in February 2007 but remains unissued over one \textbf{year later. We are being quite candid on these instances of government inaction, as they are symptoms of the concerns held more\footnote{bigram = ``of government''; score = 115.52844} broadly about the rule of law\footnote{bigram = ``symptoms of''; score = 2.38569} in Romania.\footnote{bigram = ``the concerns''; score = 0.58644}} 

 \textbf{In addition\footnote{bigram = ``held more''; score = 0.58644} to\footnote{bigram = ``more broadly''; score = 0.58644}} initiating \textbf{court charges designed to ((frustrate)) our ability to permit the project in a timely manner, our opposition has been active in a\footnote{bigram = ``project in''; score = 0.58644} political arena as well. The opposition\footnote{bigram = ``opposition has''; score = 2.26013} has orchestrated the tabling of\footnote{bigram = ``a political''; score = 28.14906} a\footnote{bigram = ``political arena''; score = 1.38119} private members bill in\footnote{bigram = ``the opposition''; score = 2.34576} the\footnote{bigram = ``opposition has''; score = 2.26013} Romanian parliament to ban the use of cyanide in\footnote{bigram = ``bill in''; score = 2.34576}} mining operations in Romania. The industry commission, the third and final commission responsible for reviewing the proposed cyanide ban in mining, amended the bill to bring cyanide use in line with EU standards, which we will be. The amended bill was placed on the agenda of the Chamber of Deputies on April 15, 2008, whereupon, the Chamber decided to have the amended bill sent back to the industry commission for further review. It is now unclear as of today when or if \textbf{this bill will reemerge from the industry commission for a vote by parliament.} 

 \textbf{((Against)) the backdrop of a potential Romanian parliamentary vote\footnote{bigram = ``vote by''; score = 2.93219} on\footnote{bigram = ``by parliament''; score = 0.37669} a ban on the\footnote{bigram = ``backdrop of''; score = 0.58644} use of cyanide in the\footnote{bigram = ``parliamentary vote''; score = 0.87894} mining\footnote{bigram = ``vote on''; score = 12.90165} industry, it\footnote{bigram = ``a ban''; score = 1.17288} appears that the Romanian government has been ((slow)) on its obligation to transpose the EU Mine Waste Directive into domestic Romanian\footnote{bigram = ``its obligation''; score = 0.62781}} law on or before May 1, 2008, an obligation included in the terms of the EU Directive on the management of waste from extractive industries. Anticipating that Romanian law would be harmonized with EU Directives, the Company has designed the project for being fully compliant with the EU Mine Waste Directive from day one of its operations. And to bring the politics in Romania into perspective, while the current minority government has used its power to block our project, the debate on the cyanide ban indicated that major parties in Romania understand \textbf{that mining can be done responsibly and is ((critical)) to the country's continued development. Those are the factors we focus on in\footnote{bigram = ``the countrys''; score = 2.93219}} our advocacy and outreach. 

 One of the co-authors of the bill to ban cyanide has put forward an initiative which would declare Rosia Montana an archeological and natural reserve. It is our understanding \textbf{that, similar to the procedures applied to the proposed bill to ban cyanide, specific committees still need to be assigned to ((deliberate))\footnote{bigram = ``to ban''; score = 4.69151} on the initiative. The timing of this is\footnote{bigram = ``be assigned''; score = 0.94172} uncertain, as are the implications\footnote{bigram = ``the initiative''; score = 0.58644} of this on our project, given the current legal framework.} 

 \textbf{Finally, our challenges in Romania notwithstanding, we are being\footnote{bigram = ``current legal''; score = 1.17288} recognized\footnote{bigram = ``legal framework''; score = 1.31841} in important\footnote{bigram = ``finally our''; score = 0.58644} political circles\footnote{bigram = ``challenges in''; score = 0.58644} as following proper procedure. In the latter part\footnote{bigram = ``in important''; score = 1.17288} of\footnote{bigram = ``important political''; score = 1.17288} 2007, project\footnote{bigram = ``political circles''; score = 2.13457} opponents sought to engage the European Commission to oppose the project. On January\footnote{bigram = ``sought to''; score = 4.10507} 24, 2008, the EU's\footnote{bigram = ``engage the''; score = 0.58644} Environmental Commissioner, writing\footnote{bigram = ``commission to''; score = 1.17288} for\footnote{bigram = ``to oppose''; score = 1.75932} the\footnote{bigram = ``oppose the''; score = 1.75932} EU Commission, stated, and I quote - "Based on all\footnote{bigram = ``writing for''; score = 3.70410}} the information received from local NGOs and individuals, as well as from the Romanian competent authorities, the Commission considers that, in principle, the procedure for the Rosia Montana project is \textbf{in compliance with the EIA Directive and with the Espoo Convention."} 

 \textbf{As for surface rights, as a result of the suspension of\footnote{bigram = ``convention as''; score = 2.38569} the EIA review process, and in order to align the\footnote{bigram = ``suspension of''; score = 2.34576} Company's activity to the pace of the approval process, on February 1, 2008, we suspended the property\footnote{bigram = ``the pace''; score = 0.58644} purchase\footnote{bigram = ``pace of''; score = 0.58644} program indefinitely.\footnote{bigram = ``the approval''; score = 2.34576} As\footnote{bigram = ``approval process''; score = 3.51863} of February\footnote{bigram = ``on february''; score = 1.00450} 2008, the Company owns\footnote{bigram = ``suspended the''; score = 0.58644}} or has options on approximately 77\% of the homes in the industrialized zone, protected area, and the buffer zone. Once we complete the agreements for institutional \textbf{properties, our ownership will rise to approximately 85\% of the three zones of the project, a fact we believe further demonstrates strong local\footnote{bigram = ``zones of''; score = 0.50225} support for our project. Ultimately, the Company's ability to obtain\footnote{bigram = ``strong local''; score = 0.58644} construction\footnote{bigram = ``local support''; score = 0.81616} permits\footnote{bigram = ``support for''; score = 39.87784}} is predicated on securing 100\% of the surface rights of the industrial zone. And, clearly, with the projects acquired to date, we are well positioned to complete surface rights acquisition once the EIA process is back on track. 

 And, at this \textbf{point, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Richard Young, for a financial update.} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{Richard Young, Gabriel Resources Ltd. - VP and\footnote{bigram = ``young for''; score = 0.50225}} CFO [4] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Thank you, Alan. Our first quarter net income was \$11 million, or \$0.04 a share, both basic and diluted. The first quarter net income included foreign exchange gains amounting to \$12.1 million on euro cash balances held to finance future planned euro-denominated development activities. 

 A total of \$16 million was spent on our development projects during the quarter compared to \$17.7 million in the year-earlier period. Most of that was spent on the acquisition of surface rights and construction of the new site - housing site. 

 Liquidity and capital resources. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at March 31 totaled \$139.2 million. 

 Project-related expenditures are expected to total \$66 million for the year, below the 2007 level, as we placed most activities on hold until EIA approval. The major expenditures this year are installment payments for long-lead-time equipment, as well as construction of the new village. 

 Project financing discussions with traditional lenders have advanced \textbf{as far as they can at this time. No further discussions can be held until EIA approval.} 

 \textbf{And, with that, I'll turn\footnote{bigram = ``discussions can''; score = 0.58644}} it back over to Alan. 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Alan Hill, Gabriel Resources Ltd. - President \textbf{and CEO [5]} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{Thanks, Richard. Now, the timeline. In terms of the timeline, once the TAC process recommences, and in the ((absence)) of\footnote{bigram = ``the timeline''; score = 1.63232} any other extraordinary events, legal or otherwise, Gabriel anticipates it will take at least six months to\footnote{bigram = ``or otherwise''; score = 1.75932}} complete the EIA process, to complete the purchase of outstanding properties, to receive all other permits and approvals, including initial construction permits, and to update the control estimate and complete the financing plan. From that point, construction of the mine would take approximately 24 months. 

 Ultimately, of course, the Romanian government determines the timing of issuance of the EIA approval and all other permits and approvals required for the Rosia Montana project. 

 The Company is using all means at its disposal to get the TAC process back on \textbf{track. We also continue to ensure that all licensing approvals are maintained in good standing in order to preserve the value of\footnote{bigram = ``are maintained''; score = 0.37669} our investment. And\footnote{bigram = ``good standing''; score = 0.58644} we are being even\footnote{bigram = ``to preserve''; score = 2.93219} more\footnote{bigram = ``preserve the''; score = 1.75932}} active in our advocacy campaign to make the case for a project that ranks among the top undeveloped gold mining assets in the world. 

 So, finally, \textbf{and in conclusion, I want to say this project will be built. In order to do so, we must remain financially strong.\footnote{bigram = ``be built''; score = 0.58644} We have strategies, political and legal, in place\footnote{bigram = ``must remain''; score = 1.25563} to get the TAC process restarted. Ultimately, as I\footnote{bigram = ``legal in''; score = 0.58644}} said earlier, we might require a change in government to get that process back. But I want to emphasize this is \textbf{a (great) deposit and a (great) project, and we have followed all EU and Romanian laws. We have strong local, regional, and\footnote{bigram = ``followed all''; score = 0.43947} national support, and we have a (great) and\footnote{bigram = ``strong local''; score = 0.58644} dedicated team,\footnote{bigram = ``regional and''; score = 1.75932} both\footnote{bigram = ``and national''; score = 16.42029} in Romania\footnote{bigram = ``support and''; score = 5.86439} and here in Toronto. We are\footnote{bigram = ``and dedicated''; score = 1.19285}} as committed as ever to permitting and building Rosia Montana. 

 And, with that, I'd like to open up the call to questions.

 Questions and Answers

 Operator [1] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Your first question will be from the line of Terence Ortslan of TSO \&amp; Associates. Please proceed. 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Terence Ortslan, TSO \&amp; Associates - Analyst [2] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Thanks. A great presentation - excellent details. Typically, one of the stakeholders is the people in the area, the community. [I went to the] \textbf{project years ago, and you've been doing (great) efforts. If one area needs a project like this to clean up the mess\footnote{bigram = ``one area''; score = 1.75932}} of going back to historical times, [this is the] project that I can see around the world. But how much of community support has been, let's say, a momentum curve for you to at least isolate any views in the government in Bucharest? 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Alan Hill, Gabriel Resources Ltd. - President and CEO [3] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 The community has been very supportive of us, as you say, locally but, also, regionally. I mean, they've initiated a march in support of our project, and they have been to Bucharest to lobby or put pressure on the government, especially with the cyanide ban and with other government initiatives, to make sure that this project gets back online. We also have the local union, which manifested itself in a national union to put the pressure onto the government. 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{Terence Ortslan, TSO \&amp; Associates - Analyst [4]} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{Okay. Is there any champion for this project of importance that can, let's say, ((undercut)) any\footnote{bigram = ``champion for''; score = 1.00450} ((negative)) efforts in\footnote{bigram = ``project of''; score = 1.63232} Bucharest\footnote{bigram = ``of importance''; score = 0.69060} at the political level?} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{Alan Hill, Gabriel Resources Ltd. - President and CEO [5]} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{That's\footnote{bigram = ``the political''; score = 51.02017} ((difficult)) to answer at the moment. We have a minority government - a government that\footnote{bigram = ``answer at''; score = 0.56503} commands only 23\% of the legislative vote\footnote{bigram = ``a minority''; score = 1.75932} there. And\footnote{bigram = ``government a''; score = 8.21014}} this is not a project-- This is not an issue, I should say, that people want to use in their march for reelection. So I don't see that as happening-- as there being a crusader for us in the nearer term. I think once the local elections are over and maybe even when the federal elections are over then we'll see that. But we'll see that more manifest in the form of party support rather than individual support. At the moment, I don't see anybody just taking that to the parliament or to the local people on an individual basis. 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Terence Ortslan, TSO \&amp; Associates - Analyst [6] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 And, Alan, one more question. In the past, [they've been in and out]. But international agencies - not the NGOs in the sense of-- let's say a restrictive sense - but in a sense of trying to guide the country, except the European Union, which you indicated about the environmental issues. Any [roll backs, IFCs, EVRDs]? Where do they stand? 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Alan Hill, Gabriel Resources Ltd. - President and CEO [7] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 We have obviously been talking to a lot of those, and I guess that's part of the advocacy that I don't really \textbf{want to get into at the moment. But you can rest assured that we are being heard very favorably, since the project\footnote{bigram = ``rest assured''; score = 0.69060} is\footnote{bigram = ``assured that''; score = 2.82516} fully in compliance and\footnote{bigram = ``being heard''; score = 0.58644} offers a lot of employment to an\footnote{bigram = ``is fully''; score = 3.70410} area that is\footnote{bigram = ``compliance and''; score = 0.58644} quite-- Well, it has high unemployment.}

 \textbf{Terence Ortslan,\footnote{bigram = ``an area''; score = 3.51863} TSO \&amp; Associates - Analyst [8]} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

 (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). Your next question will be from the line of [John Tomasos, independent]. Please proceed. 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 John Tomasos, - Analyst [10] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 I have a number of questions. First, you mention in your press release a \$66-million budget for '08. Do you have the ability to reduce that more if you think the timeframe for political change might require you to conserve your monies two, four, six, eight years out, number \textbf{one? Number two, do you know how much money is being spent to oppose you? And, number three, under any circumstances will\footnote{bigram = ``being spent''; score = 0.58644} you entertain\footnote{bigram = ``to oppose''; score = 1.75932} projects outside Romania?\footnote{bigram = ``and number''; score = 0.94172}} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{Alan Hill, Gabriel Resources\footnote{bigram = ``any circumstances''; score = 1.13006}} Ltd. - President and CEO [11] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 It wouldn't be John Tomasos if there wasn't a number of questions. Let me let Richard answer the \textbf{capital one.} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{Richard Young, Gabriel Resources Ltd. - VP and CFO [12]} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{John, the \$66 million basically ((breaks)) down-- \$50 million is comprised-- \$25 million is for\footnote{bigram = ``john the''; score = 0.58644}} the placing of-- well, installment payments under long-lead-time equipment orders. We are looking at deferring some of those. But, if we pull out of the queue with those, then we've got to reenter again. Mills are taking three years to be delivered now. If we pulled out of the queue, to place that order again would cost us at least 40\% more. So we've opted to continue with the installment payments; though things are proceeding at a slower place, so we likely-- Some of that \textbf{money will be deferred into 2009.} 

 \textbf{And then, with respect to the surface rights, we ((stopped)) the program in January. We spent about\footnote{bigram = ``the surface''; score = 3.51863}} \$6 million on that through that time. We're building one of the two communities. We're going to continue with that because we believe that we need to continue with that. Surface rights is a key issue for us longer term. We believe once a new government is in place, because the project is EU compliant, that it will move forward quickly. So the surface rights does become one of the key items that we need to address. We are looking at-- 

 The balance of the \$66 million is permitting, legal, advocacy. There might be some option later in the year to reduce some of that spending but not significantly. As we mentioned, we've got roughly \textbf{\$140 million in working capital at the end of the quarter. Keep in mind that we always do-- If things got ((delayed)) significantly,\footnote{bigram = ``keep in''; score = 0.58644} we would have the value of that\footnote{bigram = ``if things''; score = 0.58644}} mill to resell that if we needed to. 

 So that's the \textbf{first question. I'll turn it back over to Alan to answer questions two and three.} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{Alan Hill, Gabriel Resources Ltd. - President and\footnote{bigram = ``answer questions''; score = 1.17288} CEO [13]} 

 \textbf{--------------------------------------------------------------------------------} 

 \textbf{John, we don't know how much money is being spent ((against)) us at all. There are several NGOs in country\footnote{bigram = ``being spent''; score = 0.58644} that have-- They must have quite high legal bills and that,\footnote{bigram = ``country that''; score = 0.58644}} but I've got no idea from that perspective. 

 Your third question is - Would we entertain anything outside of Romania at the moment? No. Our focus is to get this project going, and the Board has agreed with that as being fundamental for this Company. I don't think we're very far away from that. I think that, once we get the TAC on track again or we get a new government or both, then things will fall into place very quickly.

 John Tomasos, - Analyst [14] 

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 For those of us that don't pay close attention to Romanian politics, and forgive me; CNN covers the U.S. more than Eastern Europe. Could \textbf{you tell us what the political parties are and which parties support your project and which ones ((oppose)) it and give us\footnote{bigram = ``parties support''; score = 0.58644} a\footnote{bigram = ``support your''; score = 0.56503}} little description of the environment in terms of pros and cons? 

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ruling-- The government at the moment comprises 23\% of the legislative vote. And that is-- It's a two-party coalition. One is the Hungarian ethnic party, and the second is the liberal \textbf{party. And it would be-- It was the forming of that minority government that commenced the opposition ((against)) us. Until then, we\footnote{bigram = ``that minority''; score = 0.94172} were proceeding in a proper,\footnote{bigram = ``the opposition''; score = 2.34576} formal manner under the earlier government. The earlier government comprised\footnote{bigram = ``a proper''; score = 2.76238}} also the-- sorry-- the democrats, which, I guess, is the President's \textbf{party.} 

 \textbf{What we've seen in the discussions on the cyanide ban is that both the liberals and the UDMR are strongly ((opposed))\footnote{bigram = ``ban is''; score = 1.00450} to it, and there's\footnote{bigram = ``the liberals''; score = 4.26913} also\footnote{bigram = ``liberals and''; score = 2.34576} a small party called the PMR which also is ((opposed)) to cyanide. But,\footnote{bigram = ``small party''; score = 0.58644} really, basically, the PSD, which\footnote{bigram = ``which also''; score = 1.17288} is the socialists, and the PD, which is the democrats, are supportive of\footnote{bigram = ``the socialists''; score = 0.43947}} the proper use of cyanide. When I say that, I mean the use under the EU Directive for mining. And they are very supportive of the mining industry. 

 Presently, the-- It is likely that the federal elections will be in November, and that doesn't include the President himself. The President comes up for election next year. But the way that things look at the moment is that the democrats will be the major party, and the socialists will be the second-largest party. These \textbf{people are supportive of use of cyanide under proper EU regulations, which, I guess, are (better) than probably normal-- which are world-standard\footnote{bigram = ``regulations which''; score = 0.58644}} regulations. 

 Does that help you?
